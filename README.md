The experimental data for the experiments reported in the main figures of Barbosa, Stein et al. (2020) can be downloaded from [a CRCNS.org repository](http://here.goes.the.link) (for monkeys), from [an OSF repository](https://osf.io/qa34s/) (for human EEG), and from [an OSF repository](https://osf.io/8e9y2) (for human TMS).

We include here the Python codes that produce each of the main figures in this article. These custom scripts were developed for Python 2.7 (monkey data, human TMS data, and computational modeling) and for Python 3.7.4 (human EEG data).
